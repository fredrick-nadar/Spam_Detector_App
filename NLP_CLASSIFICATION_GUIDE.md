## üß† How It Works

### **Classification Pipeline:**

```
Incoming SMS
    ‚Üì
1. NLP Analysis (Primary) - Fast, 15+ linguistic features
    ‚Üì
2. High Confidence (>70%)? ‚Üí Use NLP result
    ‚Üì
3. Low Confidence? ‚Üí Ask Gemini AI for second opinion
    ‚Üì
4. Combine results with weighted scoring
    ‚Üì
Final Classification (Spam/Ham)
```

## üìä NLP Features Analyzed

### **Spam Indicators:**
- **Promotional Language**: "free", "offer", "discount", "limited time", "act now"
- **Financial Scams**: "lottery", "jackpot", "winner", "claim prize", "million"
- **Phishing Attempts**: "verify account", "click link", "update password", "suspended account"
- **Urgency Score**: "urgent", "immediately", "hurry", "expires today"
- **Suspicious URLs**: Shortened links (bit.ly), domain detection
- **Excessive Capitalization**: ALL CAPS text
- **Multiple Exclamation Marks**: "!!!" spam indicator

### **Legitimate Indicators:**
- **Banking Transactions**: "credited", "debited", "INR", "Rs.", "UPI", "NEFT", "balance"
- **OTP Codes**: "OTP is 123456", "do not share", "valid for X minutes"

## üéì Training Data

The system is pre-trained with:

### **Spam Examples:**
- "Congratulations! You won 1 crore rupees. Click here now!"
- "URGENT: Your account will be suspended. Verify details immediately."
- "Free iPhone! Limited offer. Click now!"
- "You are selected for 5 lakh loan. No documents needed."

### **Ham (Legitimate) Examples:**
- "Your OTP is 123456. Valid for 10 minutes. Do not share."
- "Rs.5000 debited from account XX1234. Available balance: Rs.25000."
- "Your Amazon order has been shipped. Track at amzn.in/track/AB123456"
- "Your UPI payment of Rs.500 was successful."

## üîß How to Use

### **1. View Database**
Tap the **floating action button** (bottom right) ‚Üí **View Database**
- See all 13 messages with classifications
- Filter by: All, Spam, Ham, Unclassified
- Sort by: Date, Sender, Type
- Search messages by content/sender
- View detailed classification reasons

### **2. Reclassify Messages**
Tap FAB ‚Üí **Reclassify All**
- Re-analyzes all existing messages with new NLP system
- Updates classifications for your 13 messages
- Should fix false positives (transactions marked as spam)

### **3. Monitor Settings**
- NLP runs first (instant, no API calls)
- Gemini AI validates uncertain cases (>30% confidence threshold)
- Keyword fallback if both fail

---

## üì± Database Location

The database is stored locally on your device:
- **File**: `sms_spam_detector.db`
- **Location**: Android app storage
- **Format**: SQLite
- **Tables**: `messages`, `notification_queue`

### **Access Database:**
1. Open app ‚Üí Tap FAB ‚Üí **View Database**
2. Browse all 13 messages
3. See confidence scores and classification reasons

## üéØ Why Your Messages Were Misclassified

### **Previous System (Basic):**
- ‚ùå Only checked keywords like "free", "win", "urgent"
- ‚ùå No context understanding
- ‚ùå Bank transactions with "urgent" ‚Üí marked as spam
- ‚ùå Promotional SMS with no keywords ‚Üí missed

### **New NLP System:**
- ‚úÖ Understands **context** (banking terms + money = transaction)
- ‚úÖ Recognizes **OTP patterns** (6-digit codes = legitimate)
- ‚úÖ Detects **UPI/NEFT transactions** automatically
- ‚úÖ Analyzes **15+ linguistic features** simultaneously
- ‚úÖ Gemini AI validates uncertain cases

---

## üî¨ Technical Details

### **Libraries Used:**
- `natural`: NLP toolkit (tokenization, TF-IDF)
- `compromise`: Text analysis (sentiment, entities)
- `string-similarity`: Fuzzy matching

### **Classification Algorithm:**
1. Extract 15+ features (URLs, phone numbers, urgency, sentiment, etc.)
2. Calculate weighted spam score (0.0 - 1.0)
3. Spam indicators **increase** score (+15% per keyword, +20% urgency)
4. Legit indicators **decrease** score (-40% for OTP, -30% for banking)
5. Threshold: >0.5 = spam, <0.5 = ham

### **Confidence Calculation:**
```javascript
confidence = Math.abs(score - 0.5) * 2
// score 0.9 ‚Üí confidence 80%
// score 0.1 ‚Üí confidence 80%
// score 0.5 ‚Üí confidence 0% (uncertain)
```

## üöÄ Next Steps

1. **Reload the app** (press 'r' in Metro terminal)
2. **Reclassify all messages**:
   - Tap FAB ‚Üí "Reclassify All"
   - Wait for processing (13 messages)
   - Check if transactions are now marked as "ham"
3. **View database**:
   - Tap FAB ‚Üí "View Database"
   - Verify classifications are correct
   - Check confidence scores (should be >70%)
4. **Test with new SMS**:
   - Send test spam: "Win 1 crore! Click here now!"
   - Send test ham: "Your OTP is 123456"
   - Check classifications

## üìù Example Classifications

### **Spam Example:**
```
Message: "Congratulations! You won $1M! Click here now!!!"
Classification: SPAM
Confidence: 92%
Reason: Spam detected: 3 spam keyword(s), urgent language, 
        excessive capitalization, multiple exclamation marks (NLP)
```

### **Ham Example:**
